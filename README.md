# Executive Summary:

Between 2020 and 2023, the customer base contracted from 1,322 to 1,218, while the repeat customer rate (RCR) declined slightly from 29.5% to 28.85%. This signals challenges in both acquisition and retention. Importantly, the analysis shows that RCR is directly proportional to marketing spend â€” as investment in campaigns decreased, repeat customer rates also declined.

Despite the overall drop, referral-based marketing campaigns consistently proved to be the most effective driver of repeat purchases, underscoring the power of peer influence in fostering customer loyalty.
Sales performance across regions revealed notable shifts in market dynamics:

- The West, initially the strongest region in 2020 and 2021, declined steadily to become the weakest performer by 2023.

- The South rose sharply, overtaking other regions to secure the top spot in 2022 and 2023.

- The East remained relatively stable in the middle tier, showing consistent performance.

- The North, after ranking lowest for three consecutive years, achieved a surprising recovery in 2023, moving up to second place.

Key Takeaway: While referral campaigns are the most reliable lever for strengthening repeat purchases, future growth also depends on replicating the Southâ€™s success in other regions and addressing the Westâ€™s decline to rebalance performance.
# Business Request:
This project originated from a strategic request by the Director of Customer Engagement, who emphasized the importance of not only acquiring new customers but also ensuring that existing customers continue to return. While sales and support teams had observed recurring customer activity, leadership sought a systematic, data-driven analysis to validate these observations and uncover deeper patterns.

Specifically, the request centered on understanding:

- Whether seasonal or monthly trends exist in repeat purchases

- The contribution of returning customers to overall sales

- How these insights could inform engagement strategies and campaign optimization

The ultimate goal is to equip stakeholders with clear visual insights that will enhance strategic discussions, strengthen customer loyalty initiatives, and ensure that repeat business continues to drive long-term growth.

# Data Preparation and Visualization Approach:
Dataset used for the project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/sindhujasankararaman/Repeat-Customer-Rate-Analysis-using-Power-BI/blob/main/repeat_customer_rate_data.csv).

To ensure the accuracy and quality of the analysis, I utilized Power Query within Power BI for comprehensive data cleaning and transformation. This process involved:

- Removing duplicates and handling missing values  
- Formatting and standardizing date and categorical fields  
- Merging and shaping datasets such as customer transactions, campaign data, and regional information  
- Creating calculated columns and measures to support analysis  

For the visualization and insights delivery, I leveraged Power BIâ€™s rich visualization capabilities to build interactive dashboards that illustrate:

- Monthly and seasonal trends in repeat customer purchases  
- Geographic distribution of repeat customer rates and orders  
- The impact of marketing campaigns on repeat purchase behavior  
- Key metrics like **repeat customer rate**, **sales contribution**, and **purchase frequency**

This combination of Power Query for data preparation and Power BI for visualization enabled a seamless end-to-end analytics workflow, providing clear and actionable insights for stakeholders.

To support deeper exploration, the dashboard is fully interactiveâ€”users can hover over visuals and drill down by month, season, or year, enabling customized insights based on temporal trends.

# Business Questions:
I have delved deep into the data to answer the following business questions:

1. What is the total size of our customer base, and how many of them are repeat customers?  
2. What percentage of our customers are repeat buyers, and how does this reflect on our customer loyalty?  
3. How does the repeat customer rate vary across different time periods, such as months and seasons?  
4. Are there regional differences in the repeat customer rate that we should be aware of?  
5. How do repeat customers contribute to overall sales volume and revenue compared to new customers?  
6. What marketing efforts have been most effective in driving repeat purchases within this customer base?

# Insights:

- **Customer Loyalty:** Repeat customer rate declined slightly from **29.5% in 2020 to 28.85% in 2023**, indicating a modest dip in loyalty that warrants attention.

- **Marketing Effectiveness:** Referral-driven campaigns consistently outperform other tactics, highlighting the **power of peer influence and trust** in driving repeat purchases.

- **Marketing Spend and Sales Correlation:** Analysis shows a **direct relationship between marketing investment and sales**â€”lower marketing spend corresponds to lower sales, emphasizing the need for sustained and strategic marketing efforts.

## Regional Performance Shifts
- **South:** Emerged as the growth leader since 2022, demonstrating effective regional strategies.
- **West:** Experienced a sharp decline, moving from top performer to underperformer over four years.
- **East:** Maintained a stable, mid-tier performance with limited volatility.
- **North:** Rebounded in 2023 after prolonged underperformance, showing potential for momentum-driven growth.

**Overall Trend:** Opportunities exist to **strengthen customer loyalty**, **replicate high-performing regional strategies**, **optimize marketing spend**, and **revitalize underperforming markets** to drive balanced, sustainable growth.
