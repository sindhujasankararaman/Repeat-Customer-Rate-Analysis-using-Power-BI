# Executive Summary

Between 2020 and 2023, the customer base contracted from 1,322 to 1,218, while the repeat customer rate (RCR) declined slightly from 29.5% to 28.85%. This signals challenges in both acquisition and retention. Importantly, the analysis shows that RCR is directly proportional to marketing spend â€” as investment in campaigns decreased, repeat customer rates also declined.

Despite the overall drop, referral-based marketing campaigns consistently proved to be the most effective driver of repeat purchases, underscoring the power of peer influence in fostering customer loyalty.
Sales performance across regions revealed notable shifts in market dynamics:

- The West, initially the strongest region in 2020 and 2021, declined steadily to become the weakest performer by 2023.

- The South rose sharply, overtaking other regions to secure the top spot in 2022 and 2023.

- The East remained relatively stable in the middle tier, showing consistent performance.

- The North, after ranking lowest for three consecutive years, achieved a surprising recovery in 2023, moving up to second place.

Key Takeaway: While referral campaigns are the most reliable lever for strengthening repeat purchases, future growth also depends on replicating the Southâ€™s success in other regions and addressing the Westâ€™s decline to rebalance performance.

# Business Request:
This project originated from a strategic request by the Director of Customer Engagement, who emphasized the importance of not only acquiring new customers but also ensuring that existing customers continue to return. While sales and support teams had observed recurring customer activity, leadership sought a systematic, data-driven analysis to validate these observations and uncover deeper patterns.

Specifically, the request centered on understanding:

- Whether seasonal or monthly trends exist in repeat purchases

- The contribution of returning customers to overall sales

- How these insights could inform engagement strategies and campaign optimization

The ultimate goal is to equip stakeholders with clear visual insights that will enhance strategic discussions, strengthen customer loyalty initiatives, and ensure that repeat business continues to drive long-term growth.

# Data Preparation and Visualization Approach
Dataset used for the project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/sindhujasankararaman/Repeat-Customer-Rate-Analysis-using-Power-BI/blob/main/repeat_customer_rate_data.csv).

To ensure the accuracy and quality of the analysis, I utilized Power Query within Power BI for comprehensive data cleaning and transformation. This process involved:

- Removing duplicates and handling missing values  
- Formatting and standardizing date and categorical fields  
- Merging and shaping datasets such as customer transactions, campaign data, and regional information  
- Creating calculated columns and measures to support analysis  

For the visualization and insights delivery, I leveraged Power BIâ€™s rich visualization capabilities to build interactive dashboards that illustrate:

- Monthly and seasonal trends in repeat customer purchases  
- Geographic distribution of repeat customer rates and orders  
- The impact of marketing campaigns on repeat purchase behavior  
- Key metrics like **repeat customer rate**, **sales contribution**, and **purchase frequency**

This combination of Power Query for data preparation and Power BI for visualization enabled a seamless end-to-end analytics workflow, providing clear and actionable insights for stakeholders.

To support deeper exploration, the dashboard is fully interactiveâ€”users can hover over visuals and drill down by month, season, or year, enabling customized insights based on temporal trends.

# Business Questions
I have delved deep into the data to answer the following business questions:

1. What is the total size of our customer base, and how many of them are repeat customers?  
2. What percentage of our customers are repeat buyers, and how does this reflect on our customer loyalty?  
3. How does the repeat customer rate vary across different time periods, such as months and seasons?  
4. Are there regional differences in the repeat customer rate that we should be aware of?  
5. How do repeat customers contribute to overall sales volume and revenue compared to new customers?  
6. What marketing efforts have been most effective in driving repeat purchases within this customer base?

# Insights

- Customer Loyalty: The repeat customer rate decreased from 29.5% (2020) to 28.85% (2023), signaling a modest decline in loyalty.

- Marketing Effectiveness: Referral-based campaigns consistently outperformed other tactics, proving the strong influence of peer-driven trust in driving repeat purchases.

  **Regional Performance Shifts:**

- South has emerged as the growth leader since 2022.

- West declined sharply from leader to laggard across four years.

- East maintained stable, middle-tier performance.

- North rebounded in 2023 after years of underperformance.

Overall Trend: Growth opportunities exist in strengthening loyalty, replicating high-performing regional strategies, and addressing underperforming markets.

# Recommendations
1. Scale Referral Programs

 - Expand referral incentives and recognition programs to maximize their proven impact on repeat purchases.

2. Revitalize the West Region

- Conduct root-cause analysis to identify declining factors (e.g., competition, service gaps, product mix).

- Deploy targeted campaigns or localized promotions to re-engage this market.

3. Replicate the Southâ€™s Success

- Analyze Southâ€™s winning strategies (pricing, promotions, partnerships, customer engagement tactics).

- Adapt and roll out similar initiatives in East and North to drive balanced growth.

4. Strengthen Customer Retention Beyond Referrals

- Enhance loyalty programs, personalized offers, and customer lifecycle engagement to reduce dependence on one marketing channel.

5. Leverage Regional Insights for Targeted Growth

- Invest in region-specific analytics to tailor marketing and sales approaches.

- Double down on Northâ€™s momentum to secure its upward trajectory.

6. Continuous Monitoring

- Track repeat purchase rates and regional sales rankings quarterly to detect early shifts in performance.
